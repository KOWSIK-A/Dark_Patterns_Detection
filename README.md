# 🕵️‍♂️ Dark Patterns Detection

A **Chrome Extension** that identifies and highlights **dark patterns** on websites.  
Dark patterns are deceptive design practices that trick users into actions they didn’t intend (e.g., hidden costs, fake urgency, confusing buttons).  
This tool promotes **ethical browsing** by raising awareness of manipulative UI/UX techniques.
